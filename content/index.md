This is the place where I share my thoughts. It was [[My 2024 New Years resolution]] to create a digital garden and write something interesting to be shared every Monday. [[My 2024 New Years resolution#Regarding copyright]], this site is licensed in a way that will please you, but not please corporations.

My latest post is [[Conquer the stack]] where I think about the evolution of the internet and how you can reclaim your sovereignty from Big Tech and Big Govt.

I think you should read about [[The tragedy of Discord]] and why you should not use it for your community.
