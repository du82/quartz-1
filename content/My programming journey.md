# 2019
## Android app development
This year, I focused my efforts on the development of Bedrock Addons, a full stack Android app written in Java with a backend utilizing a standard LAMP stack, with an admin panel written in JavaScript.\

## Three.js development
I wrote a mini-game that utilized `Three.js` for graphics and real-time interaction. This mini-game was playable inside of Bedrock Addons and the first ten people to complete it won a Minecraft gift card.

>[!note]
> There's not much here due to health struggles that made me exhausted every single day for over a year.
## Mini-program ecosystem
I wrote a mini-program ecosystem for Bedrock Addons that turned HTML into native Android UI components.

# 2021
## Tor storefront
I wrote a storefront that worked over Tor despite its limitations (like functioning without javascript) and other strict security mechanisms. *I did not sell anything*, it was a just functional proof of concept. I reinstalled my OS a week later without remembering to back up anything, and lost the source code (I use LUKS so recovery was impossible).

## Dapp development
I developed a Web3 decentralized app (dapp) that used `Web3.js` and quickly gave up after I realized that most Web3 dapps aren't even decentralized, but instead hosted on Vercel, GitHub Pages, or other centralized providers with artificial requirements to log in with Ethereum added on top.

## Flutter app development
This year I changed focus to developing a full stack mobile superapp utilizing Flutter and Dart. This was so much more enjoyable for me, since you design the page UI and logic in one file, compared to having a Java and XML file like you'd have in traditional Android development.\

## Clojure and React Native
I worked for [Status.app](https://status.app) and got to learn about React Native and Clojure development. Not a tech stack that I'd ever personally choose, but it worked and was fast enough to be usable. Status if you're reading this, consider a rewrite using Flutter, it'll save thousands of hours and headaches.\

# 2023
## Experimenting with Crystal
I experimented with the Crystal programming language, although I quickly realized that it wasn't ready for production use cases and abandoned it for Rust.
## Learning Rust
This year I focused on learning the Rust programming language. I saw its intuitive packaging system for dependencies (which reminded me a lot of [pub.dev](https://pub.dev)) as well as the very helpful error messages, and I was immediately hooked.
## Matrix development
I also focused on the [Matrix](https://matrix.org) ecosystem and ended up writing lots of my software for it in the form of chat bots. I wrote every one of these chat bots in Rust as a test of my skills and a practical and fun way to learn the language.\

## Dynamic network design
I designed a network that was entirely dynamic. That means no reliance on one ISP, block or single IP, or domain name that could be censored or otherwise blocked.
## Custom P2P networking
I wrote a custom peer to peer network in Rust using UDP without any dependencies besides the standard library. This was an absolute pain and didn't end up working that well at scale without a rendezvous server.
## Gnome application
I wrote a Gnome application that simplifies my workflow a lot. One button and the whole OS is reconfigured the way I like it. Sadly I lost the source code after my cat peed on my laptop.
# 2024
## Started this website
On January 1st, 2024 I started this website. I'm not sure how it'll go just yet, but I'm going to give it my best shot so I can improve my writing skills.
## What I'd like to do this year

- [ ] Learn git - take time to actually learn how it works instead of just using GitHub Desktop as free unlimited code backup
- [ ] Learn another programming language - Potentially Kotlin, C, or Python
- [ ]
