I'm building a search engine to compete with DuckDuckGo because I'm tired of the terrible results, SEO spam, and AI generated garbage that fills the results pages of modern search engines.

# Test
## The idea
This project was started because I wanted a way to search the Tor network (dark web) and found that there were no search engines that were good enough at that task. I also wanted the search engine to be able to work on Tor's strictest settings, so it could not include any JavaScript or WASM.
In three days I had a working prototype that could read arbitrary data that was input into the dataset.
