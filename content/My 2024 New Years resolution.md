I've never cared much for New Years resolutions, but after being depressed most of 2023, I thought it was time for a change. For my 2024 New Years resolution, I promised myself that I would start a digital garden and write something every week.

Here it is, my digital (bamboo) garden. It was born on January 1st, 2024.

### Why did I choose to create a digital garden?
I've always had a fear that without sharing my thoughts, they would be forgotten permanently. This allows me to share what I think throughout the week in a way that fits me better than a structured blog. This less structured format doesn't exempt me from creating quality works, nor

### The rules I set for myself
1. I must publish something every Monday, at the very latest Tuesday morning.
2. I can correct an article the rest of the week up until Sunday night at midnight CST.
3. After that, it gets locked and I can only correct typos and factual inaccuracies such as dates.
4. Each post enters the public domain after 10 years of its publication or if I put a public domain notice at the top of the page. This whole "Life of the author + 70 years" stuff angers me. Information wants to be free!
5. I must create all diagrams and take my own pictures. These are also in the public domain after 10 years.

### Regarding copyright
Everything on this website is licensed under [Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International ](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/?ref=chooser-v1)and 10 years after its publication, each piece of writing (and all drawings, diagrams, code, and pictures) enters the public domain via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

I picked the `CC BY-NC-ND 4.0` license because I want people to be able to freely share my work, but I recognize that textbook publishers and other terrible organizations will try to take without giving back. By making attribution required, and by disallowing commercial use and derivative work, I can ensure that my work is freely shared by those with pure intentions, while making it unattractive towards those who wish to monetize it.

At the top of this page is a valid public domain notice that shows that this page is indeed in the public domain. It will always include the date that it entered the public domain as well as a link back to this section.

"Living documents" are pages that I update frequently (or are automatically updated), there's not many of them. These are exempt from the copyright rule that the rest of the pages on this site follow, and they will have a banner that says so.

Be sure to check the posts that you plan to use to make sure that they're actually in the public domain.
