Recently I've seen more and more communities utilizing Discord (the social chat app) as a means of organization and communication. It's not just the big names either, it seems to be every community that isn't privacy focused, as well as most "Web3" communities.

## You have no privacy
Discord is inherently a public platform. 
## Discord is bad for the open web
### The authwall
You've probably heard someone complain about the LinkedIn authentication popups that require you to sign in to view content. The frustration you feel when you go to check on someones profile, only to be hit with a "sign up to LinkedIn" prompt is the same frustration I and others feel towards communities on Discord.

Instead of the answer to your problem existing on a forum that's indexed by the major search engines, you spend hours digging around just to realize that the solution is buried deep inside of a community on Discord, and the only way to view it is to let them collect your data so you can join what should've been a public forum.

### Centralization
To the "server" operators out there; have you ever wondered what happens when Discord (the company) shuts down? You probably haven't. Now, think about the millions of communities that rely on Discord as their only form of communication.

### Absolutely proprietary
Despite the claims by the company that "Discord loves open-source" they in fact do not. Nothing about Discord is open source beyond some of the GPL licensed projects that they rely on for their own code. This doesn't sound like a company that loves open source and wants to contribute back. This sounds like a company that loves open source because it makes their own development cheaper.

Those that have attempted to reverse engineer and re-implement the Discord technology stack in an open-source way have been hit with [legal notices]()

## Server operators are powerless
As a server operator, you are powerless against the platform. You have no say in what features they decide to add or remove, and what other things they do. [There have been instances](https://discord.com/blog/light-theme-redeemed) where Discord have purposely made the platform worse for some users as an April Fools joke. Is that the kind of platform you want to rely on?

Is that the kind of platform you want to rely on? I hope not.

When the company introduces new features, they are typically Nitro (their 10 dollar monthly subscription) exclusive, or severely limited unless you pay. To access some of these features, your community must be paying for Nitro in order to get "Boosts" which can be used to make your server significantly more useful to everyone. The main problem? This collectively costs 140 dollars per month for the highest tier, and it is on a per-server basis. Every server that wants a decent experience must expect their members to collectively cough up $140 a month.

### You have no power
Unlike hosting your own community forum or Matrix server, you cannot ban a block of IPs that are used by adversaries to evade bans on Discord. Why? You do not own your server, the company does. The only one with power over your community is Discord themselves. This is a problem for server operators since Discord has very weak alt detection and ban evasion is trivial, as the checks happen client side.

Discord lulls you into a false sense of ownership and control, when in reality you own nothing beyond the messages you send.
